## Python

**Overview:**  
Python is a versatile language used for data analysis, machine learning, automation, and web development. I use Python for everything from quick scripting to building robust data pipelines.

**Skills & Projects**  
- **Data Analysis** with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)  
- **Machine Learning** using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)  
- **Automation Scripts** for routine tasks  
- **Web Development** with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

## SQL

**Overview:**  
Structured Query Language (SQL) is essential for querying and managing relational databases. It’s at the core of most modern data systems.

**Skills & Projects**  
- **Database Design & Normalization**  
- **Queries & Joins** (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)  
- **Window Functions & Subqueries**  
- **Performance Tuning** with Indexing  
- **ETL Pipelines & Data Warehousing**
