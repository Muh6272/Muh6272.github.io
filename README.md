<summary>📘 **Python Topics** (Click to Expand)</summary>

<details>
<summary>Basics</summary>

##### **Math Operators**
From highest to lowest precedence:

| Operators | Operation          | Example        |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------|
| `**`      | Exponent           | `2 ** 3 = 8`   |
| `%`       | Modulus/Remainder  | `22 % 8 = 6`   |
| `//`      | Integer division   | `22 // 8 = 2`  |
| `/`       | Division           | `22 / 8 = 2.75`|
| `*`       | Multiplication     | `3 * 3 = 9`    |
| `-`       | Subtraction        | `5 - 2 = 3`    |
| `+`       | Addition           | `2 + 2 = 4`    |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Built-in Functions</summary>
  
- **Class**: Used to create objects that encapsulate data and behavior
- **Funcation**: Reusable blocks of code
- **Variable**: used to store data, and each variable has a data type 

</details>

<details>
<summary>Data Structures</summary>

  - **List**: Stores multiple items in an ordered sequence and allows modifications. 
    `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`  

  - **Tuples**: is like a list but cannot be modified after creation. 
    `("apple", "banana", "cherry")`
        **Rules (Tuples)**: print only unique value, memory efficient 

  - **Set**: is a collection of unique items.  
    `{"apple", "banana", "cherry"}`  

  - **Dictionary**: Stores data as key-value pairs. 
    `{"name": "Moe", "age": 30}`
        **Rules (Set and Dictionaries)**: Curly brackets, Unique value, order doesn't matter
  - **List Comprehensions**: List comprehension is a concise, efficient, and readable way to create lists in Python. Instead of using for loops, it allows you to generate lists in a single line of code. new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
</details>

<details>
<summary>Control Flow</summary>
  
  - **statement**: if, elif`, `else`
  - **loops**: Iterates over a sequence
  - **While loops**: Repeats while a condition is true
